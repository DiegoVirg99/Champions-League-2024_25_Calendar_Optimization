In this repository, I created a mathematical model (.mod) for the optimization of the UEFA Champions League 2024_25 draw and schedule.
The model was created using integer linear programming and subsequently coded in OPL (IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio) - Operational Research.

In the .mod file, you can find the mathematical model (in OPL - to be opened with CPLEX) with:
- variables definition;
- hard constraints;
- soft constraints;
- objective function.

In the .dat file, you can find the data of the teams participating in the UEFA CL 2024/25, necessary to launch the corresponding optimization instance (in OPL).

*I suggest to open the files with IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio*

These files are part of my Master's thesis. 

In the .pdf file, you can find an ABSTRACT with the mathematical model (codified, then, in OPL - .mod file).
